# Kitchen 911

Designed by developers with professional Chef collaboration.

Using a Food2Fork API, Kitchen 911 was created to help find creative recipe ideas along with sharing expert culinary help if needed. The website allows you to search for keywords that link to recipes from food2fork.com; however on Kitchen911, you are able to save those recipes in your "recipe box" (a feature), where the user can add their own personal notes about said recipe: "what worked," "what tweaks need to be made," and "what was the Chef's advice when I ran into a problem?" Futhermore, using the MIT firebase Firechat, users can contact personal and professional help in real time (another feature).
